## My process

I started with laying out elements using mix of flexbox (mostly with flex-direction set to column) and grid. I styled elements that will change with Dark Mode inside HTML using CSS custom variables and other in CSS. For the logic implementation I used vanilla JS with lots of functions and some if/ if else statements.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

I recaped a lot about JS and creating logic for different cases scenarios. I managed to debug my own code pretty well and overall I'm happy with ly work :)

### Continued development

Continued development of my understanding in CSS flex and grid as well as Vanilla JS.
